		<h1>Index / Garden</h1>
		<p>If this is an index of something, what is that thing? Perhaps instead of engineering some grand scheme of interconnected ideas, I should instead allow myself to be disjointed, making things which do not need to be related by any criteria except for the fact that they happen to share an index. Maybe this is the front page of my own personal internet? (What does that even mean?) (I don&rsquo;t really know what I&rsquo;m doing.) (Do you?)<br><br>Some of these things may become something, some may not. Who knows where these ideas may lead.

    <ul>
      <li>A big messy collection of .GIFs I have made.</li>
      <li>A collection of drinks I have drunk. Nothing high-brow like tasting notes, but more of an excuse to make a typology. (Inspired by the ongoing thread in the Intro to Coding Slack channel.)</li>
      <li>Photographs of construction cones, doing things cones shouldn&rsquo;t do.</li>
      <li>An elaborate maze of nested tables.</li>
      <li>Notes to self. Regarding learning code? Regarding anything and everything in life?</li>
    </ul>
