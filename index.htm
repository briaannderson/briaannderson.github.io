			<p><date>April 22, 2021</date>An <a href="sketchpad.htm" target="_blank">HTML sketchpad</a>. Just doodling things I'm learning and elements I may want to reuse some day.</p>
			<p><date>This does not exist</date>A big messy collection of .GIFs I have made.</p>
			<p><date>This does not exist</date>A collection of drinks I have drunk. Nothing high-brow like tasting notes, but more of an excuse to make a typology. (Inspired by the ongoing thread in the Intro to Coding Slack channel.)</p>
			<p><date>This does not exist</date>Photographs of construction cones, doing things cones shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
