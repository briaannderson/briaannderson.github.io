		<h1>Brian’s Kewl FAQ Page.</h1>
		<h6>I&rsquo;m writing these as they come to me. No real order here. Here’s how to get <a href="index.htm">back home</a>. Yes, this is h6.</h6>
		<h2>Week 1</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In our code editor, why and how do we use tabs/indentation smartly? Are tabs meant to symbolize nested elements?<br></li>
			<li>I&rsquo;ve heard of this thing called SCSS (or is it SASS?) Will this be something relevant to learn about in class?<br></li>
			<li>I assume we should be keeping a strict file naming convention—no capitals, no spaces, etc?<br></li>
			<li>Does it matter what order we nest elements, so long as they&rsquo;re symmetrical?<br></li>
			<li>What are subdomains and how should they be used? Wondering because of the way our GitHub pages are written.<br></li>
			<li>Is there any tool we can use to universally replace characters? For instance, can a curly apostrophe [ &rsquo; ] replace [ ' ]. I would love to automate this somehow. (On second thought I wonder if this is just a cmd-F thing to find and replace)<br></li>
			<li>Are there any big downsides to hosting everything we do on GitHub? Is it slow or limited to a certain number of pages or anyting? Seems like a great way to host things. But I wonder how they afford unlimited storage? How do we get this for free without ads and stuff? Pure benevolence from strangers?</li>
			<li>Is there any way to commit/publish directly from Atom? I seem to have found a way to commit, but no way to publish. Also seems like you don't get the nice visual of what changes were made that you get in the GitHub app. Seems like the GitHub app is a weird extra step in the process, but I guess I can learn to love it!</li>
